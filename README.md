# PyNAS

<br>
PyNAS is a lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached storage</a> manager.
<br>
Basically, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">Cloud Storage</a> that you host yourself!

## So what are the advantages?
Well, of the biggest advantage is that it's 100% private, you don't have to take my word for it though, go through the code yourself!

Also, there isn't a "Storage Limit". You can upload as many files as you like if you have enough space!

# How do I use it?
First you need to have <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> installed.

Then you're going to install the dependencies by this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After it's installed, you're ready to run it using this command:

```
python server.py
```

Now, your very own Cloud Storage is running. If you want, you can also install something like <a href="https://ngrok.com">Ngrok</a> to access your Cloud Storage across the network!
